Having trouble pulling updates from master? (fatal: coudn't find remote ref master)

Try the following to fix your remote/upstream references:

git pull origin
git checkout -b main
git branch main -u origin/main
git remote set-head origin main
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
git branch -d master
git branch -d -r origin/master
